Meeting With Kevin

Been here for a month so getting my bearings in order.
worked with Shutterstock for 7 yrs, and now with Giphy on the API and Search team.

Culture
So we are seeing a melding of 2 different cultures. 
    It's imp to do a reset and ensure people have enough time to adapt to a new culture which can be an amalgamation of the two cultures.
    In some cases we might even refer to the same thing with the same words but the interetation of that might be quite different.

Partner Integrations
For the growth of our business, we need to figure out the proper support for the partner integrations team,
Today we have a sales person and a Business Development Leader who manages the account. 
we need to find a way to provide better support. 

It would be nice if product teams had a normal intake process which could help provide support to the partner integrations team.

Founder Mode and Urgency
    There is a lot of process where it doesn't need to be. Dev and Product relationship will need a second look

    Some Odd Processes
        Product would police essnetially all convos, the old giphy devs were siloed, teams were siloed, only
        folks who could talk to one another were the product folks.

    No Scrum activity, no retros, no sprint plannings with poker planning.

    Dev Velocity
        THis also is affected and burdened by all the heavy processes, like Decision Briefs. Essentially countless ways
        to slow down work. 
            

It's imp to reiterate to teams we need to move fast. We need to work fast and turnaround on things even quicker

Less Policiing and more Collaborating.
